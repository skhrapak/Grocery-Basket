# Grocery-Basket
Learning project on data management using Python.

1. Introduction.

Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they
want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. 

2. Objectives

The goal is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data using Python in order to derive insights and suggest 
strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

The key questions to be answered are 

● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the
day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at
times when there are fewer orders.

● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people
spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at
these times.

● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to
use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.

● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of
product orders.

● The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of
customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ.

3. Dataset

Instacart is a real company that’s made their data available online. However, the contents of the datasets have been fabricated for the purpose of this learning project.

4. Content

The repositoty contains Project Brief, Python script used to produce the final Report as well as the final rfeport itself.
